Payday loans, also known as cash advances, are short-term, low-balance, high-interest loans typically at usury rates. They are so named because the funds are typically borrowed on a postdated check or account withdrawal authorization effective on the borrowerâ€™s upcoming payday.

These loans are designed to be quick and generally easy to qualify for if the applicant has a job, a valid form of identification, a checking account, and is age 18 or older.
