The loan can be approved in as little as 15 minutes. In most circumstances, the borrower writes a check for the loan amount plus a lending fee, and the lender holds onto the check until a predetermined due date.1

Unlike personal loans, payday loans are intended to last just a few weeks. When the loan comes due, the borrower either pays it off or allows the lender to cash the postdated check or withdraw it from the borrowerâ€™s account.
