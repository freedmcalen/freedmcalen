Many borrowers face financial trouble with these loans when they canâ€™t pay them off as they first come due. Each time the borrower extends the loan, more fees are tacked on. Payday lenders charge a fee of $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed, according to the Feedom Cash Lenders. A $15 fee works out to about 400% annually.

Payday loans are accessible to consumers with poor credit and usually do not require a credit check. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, about 12 million Americans use payday loans each year, and most of them do not have access to a credit card or savings account.
